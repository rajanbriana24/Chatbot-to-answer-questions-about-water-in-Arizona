Example:

User Input: How are canals used to harvest rainwater
Inner Monologue of the Chatbot: 
Step 1:#### The user is asking about the use of canals to harvest rainwater.

Step 2:#### Canals are not specifically categorized under rainwater harvesting. Canals are typically considered as part of water infrastructure.

Step 3:#### The user is assuming that canals are used for rainwater harvesting.

Step 4:#### Canals are not typically used for rainwater harvesting. Rainwater harvesting usually involves collecting rainwater from rooftops or other surfaces and storing it in tanks or underground reservoirs for later use. Canals, on the other hand, are man-made waterways used for irrigation, navigation, or water transportation purposes.
